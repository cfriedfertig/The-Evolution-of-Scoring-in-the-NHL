CSCI 334 (Data Mining) Final Project
By: Chase Friedfertig and Charles Fuller
Welcome to the github for our final project, The Evolution of Scoring in the NHL!
Necessary softwares: RapidMiner Studio 
Dataset(copy and paste into search bar): quanthockey.com

**What is this?**
We compared statistics of the top 10 National Hockey League (NHL) point scorers in the following seasons: 1998-1999 (the first season that all the data we need was all collected), 2008-2009, and 2018-2019. We are going to use these statistics to find patterns in based on the year and develop a thesis regarding the evolution of scoring. We used this data and our knowledge of the game to pick variables that we thought had a high effect on scoring.

**First Step** Scraping the Data
Download the data. Go to quanthockey.com and select year-by-year (2018-2019, 2008-2009, 1999-1998) and click export to excel for each (you should have 3 excel files). Once downloaded, we recommend renaming them by the year and putting them all in one folder so you can keep track of it. 

**Second Step** Cleaning the Data
Open one of the excel sheets:
Select the entirety of cells 13-52
  REFERENCE: Look at lefthand side and click your shift button, and then on 13, and then continue to hold onto shift and click 52, then right click and click delete. 
  
Repeat this step for your other 2 excel sheets. 

Done? Great! Now you have your top ten for that year.

**Third Step** Creating a Process
Open up RapidMiner Studio and create a blank process,
REFERENCE: If you aren't immediately prompted to start a new process, go to "File", "New Process", "Blank Process". Now you are ready to get started.

**Fourth Step** Importing the Dataset
